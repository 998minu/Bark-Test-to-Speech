Certainly! Here's a more human-centered version of the problem statement:

Imagine you're a news anchor delivering breaking headlines to the world. Your job is to capture the audience's attention and accurately convey the news's essence. But you don't just read the words; you bring them to life with your voice!

Can you write a program that acts like a news anchor? It should take any news headline as input, understand the sentiment behind it (is it good news, bad news, funny, surprising?), and then generate audio that reads the headline to match that sentiment.

For example:

Headline: "Scientists discover cure for common cold!"
Your program should generate audio spoken with excitement and joy, reflecting the positive news.
Headline: "Major earthquake strikes, causing widespread damage."
Your program should generate audio spoken with seriousness and concern, reflecting the event's severity.
